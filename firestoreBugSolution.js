The solution involves implementing robust error handling and potential retry mechanisms. Here's how to modify the code:

```javascript
// firestoreBugSolution.js

db.collection('myCollection').doc('myDoc').set(data)
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Data written with success!');
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error writing document: ', error);
    // Implement retry logic here.  This may involve exponential backoff or similar techniques.
  });
```

This improved approach includes a `.catch` block to handle potential errors during the write operation.  More sophisticated solutions might include retry mechanisms with exponential backoff to handle temporary network issues or transient Firestore service problems.
